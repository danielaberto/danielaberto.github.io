        		<h1>Hello!</h1>
                <h2>I'm Daniela, Creative Producer based in Berlin</h2>
        			<p>I research, write and facilitate the creation of communication frameworks and media forms, such as animated films, documentaries, visual essays, and interactive forms, that help to convey an idea, a difficult subject, or theme in a clear and understable way.</p>.

 <p>I experiment through different context, media and technologies,
                 in collaboration with writers, journalists, directors, developers, animators, designers,
                         and researchers of any type.</p>

 <p>In my past life I was a founder of a digital/design studio and I have done projects for commercial, cultural or no-profit organizations <a href="http://www.neuebig.com/selected-works/">Neue Big/works</a>, previously worked inside an NGO (ActionAid), a 2000 dot.com startup (Lastminute.com) and various companies.

I’m now seeking for a new model to create independent, qualitative, sustainable, critical work, free from corporate mindset and unbalanced interests.

				<h2>Projects</h2>
                <p> I'm currently working at a new project (text/essay + animation + interactive framework) to explain
                how the implementation of new technologies will help spreading the Open Access mode of publishing within a European Open Science Infrastructure.<br>



        I hold a Master’s Degree in Law (my Thesis, in Philosophy of Law/ Bioethics, investigated an Italian case of Euthanasia and analyzed the international debate from different perspectives: philosophical, legal, ethical, and medical) and a post degree master in Digital Economy,

 Among my current interests: Medical Humanities, Critical Visual Studies and Critical Tech.

<h2>Experiments</h2>

			</p>


			<p>In 2013 I've started a side project called <b>'VisualBook'</b>, which has become an in-depth research on arguments/
language/debate analysis. The aim is to achieve a better understanding and synthesis about critical themes,
				exploring multiple perspectives.</p>
