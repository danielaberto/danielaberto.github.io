        		<h1>Hello! I'm Daniela.</h1>
        			<p>I research, write and produce animated films,<br>
					visual essays, and interactive formats that helps to understand subjects  
					in a clear and concise way. <br>
		
					 <p>I experiment through different context, media and technologies, 
				 in collaboration with writers, journalists, directors, developers, animators, designers,
						 and researchers of any type.</p>  
			
			<p> I'm currently starting a new project (text/essay + animation + interactive framework) to explain
				how the implementation of new technologies will help spreading the Open Access/Open Science mode of publishing.<br>
			</p>
			
	
			<p>In 2013 I've started a side project called <b>'VisualBook'</b>, which has become an in-depth research on arguments/
language/debate analysis. The aim is to achieve a better understanding and synthesis about critical themes,
				taking into account multiple perspectives.</p>
