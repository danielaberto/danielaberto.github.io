        		<h1>Hello!I'm Daniela</h1>
        			<p>I research, write and produce short animated films and documentaries, visual essays and interactive forms, that help to convey an idea, a difficult subject, or theme in a clear and understable way.</p>.

 <p>I experiment through different context, media and technologies,
                 in collaboration with writers, journalists, directors, developers, animators, designers,
                         and researchers of any type.</p>


				<h2>Projects</h2>
                <p> I'm currently working at a new project (text/essay + animation + interactive framework) to explain how the implementation of new technologies will help spreading the Open Access mode of publishing within a European Open Science Infrastructure.</p>



<h2>Experiments</h2>

			</p>


			<p>In 2013 I've started a side project called <b>'VisualBook'</b>, which has become an in-depth
                independent research on arguments/
language/debate analysis. The aim is to achieve a better understanding and synthesis about critical themes,
				exploring multiple perspectives.</p>

                  <p>I hold a Master’s Degree in Law at Università Statale di Milano (my Thesis, in Philosophy of Law/ Bioethics, investigated an Italian case of Euthanasia and analyzed the international debate from different perspectives: philosophical, legal, ethical, and medical) and a post degree master in Digital Economy.</p>
