        		<h1>Hello! I'm Daniela</h1>
        			<p>I research, write and produce short animated videos, visual essays 
					and multimodal formats that help to convey the essence of a subject in a clear
					and accessible way.</p>
			
			 <p>I run an independent studio - Neue Big - experimenting  with different media, context and technologies,
                 in collaboration with writers, directors, animators, developers, designers, and researchers of any type.</p>
			
                <p> Here’s a selection of commercial, cultural and academic work 
 <a href="http://www.neuebig.com">work</a> created since 2007.</p>

                  <p>I hold a Master’s Degree in Law (my Thesis, in Philosophy of Law/ Bioethic, investigated an Italian case of Euthanasia and analyzed the international debate across disciplines and perspectives)
			  and a post degree Master in Digital Economy.</p>
			
			<p>Over the last 4 years I had to deal with 5 surgeries and health issues, that slowed my life and work down, but this helped to reconnected with my passions and purpose.<br>
				I’m currently interested and researching the field of health/medical humanities.

				please feel free to contact me at danielaberto AT posteo .de </p>
