        		<h1>Micro Bio - Daniela Berto</h1>
			
			 <p> I run an independent studio - Neue Big - specialising in knowledge and communication forms on tech, science, medicine, society, and culture. 
				By researching and analysing topics with subject experts, using plain language and multimodal media, we help to convey messages in a concise way,
improve the understanding of complex issues and concepts, and increase dialogue and cooperation among people.</p>
			
			<p>We support authors, researchers, academics, policy-makers, advocacy organisations,
			to build their communication, outreach, and educational strategy and formats.</p>
			
			<p>I hold a Master’s Degree in Law (my Thesis, in Philosophy of Law/ Bioethics, investigated an Italian case of Euthanasia and analysed the international debate across disciplines and perspectives) and a post-degree Master in Digital Economy. I’m currently studying Philosophy at Università di Milano
			and interested in the field of health/medical humanities and ethical tech.</p>
			
                        <p> Here’s a selection of <a href="http://www.neuebig.com">work</a> created for commercial, cultural and academic organisations since 2007.</p>
